## Pitt CS Dept.

Laboon said he certainly saw a value in this and, based on our description of a Travis CI+GH Edu+grade tracking, he would pay $10/mo, per class, at least, out of his own personal pocket. He said that we should be targetting lecturers (professors who teach) and adjuncts, because the product is closer tailored to low-level courses (0007, 0401, etc.), and those are the people teaching those courses. He said there's a lot of turnover with adjuncts in the dept., so this would give the dept. a way to onboard adjuncts easily (they can teach from pre-defined projects, for example), and spare the adjunct ramp-up time. He said that we should be careful because this will mainly cut into TA hours, and the dept. ​wants​ TAs to have jobs and they work for cheap, so there isn't much value-add in reducing TA work. He said the department works more like islands than it does hierarchy, and that we should try to "sell" to individual professors, who can campaign on our behalf for the department. The other way is impossible: it's too hard to force individual professors to all get on board with the same thing top-down, but if we can convince each one that it will be beneficial to him or her, then we can influence the dept. And most of the value-add is at the professor level; we are saving them time and effort. It's ​possible​ that we could literally sell the product itself to each professor, but there's not as much money available there.

In response: in v1 we focus on the individual professors of the courses the product will most benefit: 007, 0401, 445, etc., wherein the product can run automated grading easily. And v2, we open it up to manual testing and grading (via TA, etc.), wherein the value would be simply a git-based cloud storage. This means that we can convince the dept. that it will be valuable to ​all​ courses (though it will be ​more​ valuable to the low-level courses, still), making it in their best interest to buy one large subscription for all courses, rather than individual ones (and we should have the support of our trial-run courses to back this up).
