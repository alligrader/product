Therese is a junior, who TA'd both CS 0004 and CS 0401 this semester for the first time. 

-------------------------------------

# CS 0004

For 0004, the class does not have recitations, so her job was entirely office hours. However, because many students came to office hours, they were held in 5505 like a regular recitation. In order to have your lab graded, you had to show it to Therese in person. She would give full credit if it functioned correctly, so grading labs was really just a pass/fail smell check.

She told a story about the day of the final project. She had office hours from 1-3pm, and the project was due at 3pm. The classroom was entirely full, and she didn't have the bandwidth to help someone if it wasn't an error she could fix in a minute of less. It would have been more beneficial to have more TAs or more office hours earlier in the day.

On occassion, there was no driver program for the assigned lab. This meant Therese had to write her own driver and email it out to the students. There was a student that didn't use the driver she provided, so Therese couldn't give her full creditic because she "didn't know how the fuck to grade it when I couldn't test all the functionality".

She was a TA for 4 hours a week.
Sam Kopansky was the other TA. I know him, and I could interview him as well.

# CS 0401

Therese TA'd 401 for Dave Krebs, who is an adjuct professor. Therese had taken both 0007 and 0401 withKrebs prior.

Krebs himself grades all projects. Therese graded labs. The class did not have quizzes.

Therese then spoke about the the TA luncheon. The luncheon was held during finals week (only a couple of weeks ago). She said the attendees were all of the undergrad TAs, plus Mackenzie, Angela, and Ramirez.

Emilee hinted that she was grading, and Angela and Ramirez perked their ears up and immediately were like "What do you __mean__ you were grading?". Emilee explained she was just smell-checking labs, and Angela and Ramirez were like "Undergrad TAs __are not__ supposed to be grading projects or quizzes."

Conversation then turned to the importance of manditory labs. Ramirez said there was a professor who didn't make labs manditory. The students had to attend recitation but they didn't have to complete the labs. The result was that the class's grades were lower, and retention was down, because students weren't practicing their fine-grained skills. They were only practicing during projects, which is a course-grained approach. Ramirez thinks that labs need to be graded as a result. However, he's sympathetic to students that don't have time to get labs done because they're working on projects.

Ramirez said that there's also a bit of a trade off in teacher's time. If the teacher has to grade the projects, labs, and exams, he has to make everything easy to grade. Because of this, **Ramirez said the department has been looking into script grading.**

A student brought up that Farnan, Garrison, and Laboon have been teaching Git. The student said that it would be cool if other professors taught Git like Laboon does. Ramirez said git would be cool, but if a teacher wants to teach git, they necessarily have to remove something else from the curriculum. He was open to it, but just noted that there was another necessary tradeoff.

# As a Student

Therese feels like 75-80% of the time, the grade she gets on a project is the grade she expected to get. However, she felt like CS 1550 was a total crap-shoot, and she was really upset about it. She went on to say that in all of the upper level classes, because it takes so long to grade assigments, you typically get back Projecs 1 and 2, and the midterm, but you have no idea what your grade is for the entire second half of the semester because professors don't return Project 3 until Finals week at best. (This was not Project 1, 2, 3 for a specific class, this was generalized to all classes.) 

She mentioned that the University of Maryland uses an autograder for all of their assignments (Maryland has a couple of hidden tests that they don't show students). Jack McQuown has a friend who could give us more information. I know someone there too who owes me a favor.

She said autograding would help her focus on getting the best score possible since she would know which sections of her project she should focus on. More than improving her grade (which she was lukewarm about), she feels like it would reduce stress since there's less uncertainty. She said she would have more "peace of mind".

About style points, she thinks 401 is the only class that should really have style points. She thinks CS majors would really benefit from a static style checker. She thinks they would make changes to their projects to address the style checker, unlike nonmajors who probably care less about the 5 points and are only taking the class to learn a little coding.
