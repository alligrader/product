Lectures: 0, 1, 1.5A, 1.5B

### Lecture 0

Brought to you by tweed jackets.

The Business Model Canvas is a good tool to manage the growth, resources, and needs for startups.

Launchpad Central is a paid community resource for collaboration.

### Lecture 1

Previously, it was suggested that founders first research and write a sweeping business plan and follow it. We believe this to be be unproductive now.

The Dutch East India Company was the first modern company. The Hardvard MBA was created in 1908 in response to globalization.

Startups are not smaller versions of large companies--all the traditional tools taught in an MBA program are irrelevant in the first few years (albeit useful eventually).

Startups spend more time "searching", while large companies "execute".

Again, previously, businesses researched a master business plan, like a weather forecast, and executed closely to outline. Today we know that no business plan survives first contact with cutomers, and the immediate growth of a startup is too chaotic to predict.

We should still plan and forecast. In fact, we need planning before the plan. We should be researching and coming up with hard facts _before_ we begin long-term planning. We can use the Business Model Canvas as a basis for this initial pre-planning. The BMC will allow us to organize our thinking, get out of the building, and keep score of our progress. So we're finding the model and only then writing it up in a plan. Think: Agile v. Waterfall.

It turns out, initial startup customers are generally not mainstream. And you shouldn't assume that you understand your customers' needs before you get their feedback.

[Insert The Waterfall Development strawman]

Customer development is a company's search for a business model. It contains two parts: the searching, which contains customer discovery and customer validation, and the execution, which contains the customer creation and company building. We'll mostly cover the Search.

In addition to the customer development process is the agile product development process. Iteration is key, including testing and customer feedback.

*Extreme* programming.

Most startups fail because they can't find a customer base to sustain themselves. But it could also fail from: cofounders fighting, inability to build the initial spec, or lack of funding.

Build a functional organization. You don't _need_ to replicate the heirarchy of large companies. Instead, the founders need to run a Customer Development Team, rather than Sales, Marketing, Bus. Dev, etc. Founders need to be out in the real world understanding their customers. Likewise, the job specification (i.e. VP of Sales) carries much different responsibilities in a startup than in a large company.

This course focuses on the Search -- the search for a business model.

### Lecture 1.5A

A company is a business organization that sells a product or service in exchange for revenue and profit.

A startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.

A business model is how companies create a value for itself by selling a product or service to its users.

From the BMC:

The value proposition is: what are you solving and for whom? It's not about an idea or a product; it's about solving a problem. The customers don't care about your technology, they either have a problem or a need.

Customer segments is a breakdown of your userbase. Understand that you must exist for your customers.

Channels are the mediums for how the product reaches the customer. Previously, the only channels were physical channels.

Customer relationships map how to get and keep customers.

Revenue streams are the tangible money-making strategies, answering how we make money from each customer segment.

Key resources: assets required to make the business model succeeed (human, financial, physical, scientific, etc.).

Key partnerships. Always consider: What are we qcquiring from partners and what key activities do they perform?

Key activities are the most important things that need to be done in order to make the business work.

Costs operate the business models. Look at the difference between fixed and variable costs, and gauging their importance.

### Lecture 1.5B

We can use the BMC to create hypotheses. We want then change the guesses into facts. You can blow up the canvas and put it on a wall, then get out of the office and interacting with stakeholders to factualize the guesses. You continually iterate with process until you have a business model and can move into the execution. This is the customer development process, and it should be done by the founders; an employee doesn't have the vision. Even the founders realize the their original vision is inaccurate, they only are capable of changing the course of the company. When we gather insights from customers, we create a new BMC entirely. We should maintain the old BMCs for reference, though.

Previously, products would be developed from beginning to end with as many features as possible. A minimum viable product is only a best-guess prototype that doesn't waste resources.

You are not Steve Jobs or Henry Ford. Go out and get feedback from the users.

A pivot is when your hypothesis doesn't meet reality. You need to reevaluate the business model. Embrace these changes.

Phase 1: Create BMC. Phase 2: Get out and test the problem with user feedback. Phase 3: Test the solution with market feedback. Phase 4: verify your pivot and ensure you have an enthusiastic customer base. Phase 5: Customer validation. If no phases pass, pivot and try again.

Customer validation is proving that you have product market fit. You get ready to sell and attempt to integrate into the market.

The market opportunity analysis involves identifying customers and market need and sizing the market and competitors to determining the value of the opportunity. Total available market is the number of customers that want or need the product and how much they're willing to pay for it. Often there are research reports available by Wall St. brokers. The served available market is the realistic projection based on the constraints of the market opportunity analysis. The target market is a further narrowing of the market to the people who you are trying to sell to. After analysis, determine is the opportunity worth it?

## Session 2

Lectures: 2, 3, 5

### Lecture 2

The value proposition is what you are building. It's not just about your idea or product; it's about solving a problem or filling a need for customers. Product-Market fit is simply your product or service's ability to solve a (paying) user's problem, between the value proposition and customer segments.

You need to also consider what gain you are created for customers and what pain your solving. It's not just about features for the sake of features. The smallest possible feature set that we could ship on day one is the minimum viable product for a known group of customers. Don't match competitors featurs unless your customers explicitely ask for that.

Create customer archtypes who can generically represent your customer base. Engineering should be familiar with these archetypes.

The business model canvas is just a start. It's just hypotheses.

A problem is a tangible and limited pain; a need is a general and universal pain. Rank your potential users' pain by frequency and intensity to guage the importance of your value. Also analyze the gain that the product offers: how the users' life is improved from its current state. And again, rank it by importance.

First, create a lo-fidelity prototype (interactive wireframe) that you can demo and test with users and iterate on these lo-fi prototypes before you build your product, to avoid wasting resources. Use this to determine the minimum viable product. MVP is not alpha/beta test. The goal is not to find the bugs, it's to test the value proposition.

There needs to be people who are demanding this product (not only enoying it), and there needs to be enough of them.

For your value proposition, question: your competitors, your market size, your feasibility, etc.

### Lecture 3

The product-market fit is the relationship between the value proposition and customer segments.

Determine the jobs that needs to be done and rank each according to its significance to the customer. You should be able to outline all of the jobs of a customer archetype for any given day. Determine the pains and gans for these customer archetypes as well.

Analyze customers in context of other customers: some customers might be gates to others, for example. There could be an: influencer, reccommender, decision maker, economic buyer, and even sabatoer, who could interact with a given user.

Pass/Fail signals and experiments are used to discover customers. For business-to-business products, you only need to test around 20 people, while with global user-facing products require hundreds and thousands of users tested.

You could have a multi-sided market: that is, multiple dissimilar customers, with entirely different BMCs, generally split into users and payers. There may be dependencies between customer segments.

There's four types of Market Types: existing markets, resegmented market, new market, and clone market. The market changes everything: it changes your sales model, your market size, your launch type, profitability and cost, etc.

An existing market is already established in users and competitors. A Resegmented market could have few competitors if it truely is separate, else it might be saturated already. A new market is a totally fresh playing field: no customers or users. A clone market has the same users, and usually few competitors, and it is localized to a region or niche.
