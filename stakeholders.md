### University Leadership

- The university leadership would be responsible for buying licenses in bulk for the department.
- Although the natural flow of interest is likely grassroots--from the professors up to the department, the department has robust budget, and could easily cover the costs for all professors.
- Our major value-add to departments is that we: reduce workload on lecturers and TAs, allow for easy on-boarding of new lecturers, provide a medium for quantitative student performance analysis, and provide a vehicle for consistent course content.

### Teachers

- University professors are regarded as islands--capable of choosing what tools to use and willing to spend their own personal money on tools that will give them back their free time.
- Specifically, we should target lecturers, especially lecturers of lower-level courses, and new lecturers.
- Lecturers can be great advocates on our behalf for department licenses.
- Our major value-add to lecturers is time-saving and simple course management.
